# @computesdk/tensorlake

## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- 620c463: Skip the line-less terminal event Tensorlake's follow streams emit at end-of-stream; interpolating it unconditionally appended a literal `undefined` line to every streamed command's stdout and stderr. Buffered output (`getStdout`/`getStderr`) is filtered the same way.

## 0.1.15

### Patch Changes

- computesdk@4.1.8
- @computesdk/provider@2.1.9

## 0.1.14

### Patch Changes

- 1f0a8f4: Resolve relative `filesystem.*` paths to an absolute workdir before calling the provider's filesystem API (which requires absolute paths). Relative paths now resolve against the sandbox's exec cwd — falling back to `$HOME` on Tensorlake when the cwd isn't writable — matching what `runCommand` execs see. `.` and duplicate slashes normalize; `..` is preserved for physical resolution.

  - computesdk@4.1.6
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.7

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 3914faa: Fix disk sizing on sandbox create: `ephemeralDiskMb` was passed under a name the Tensorlake SDK's `Sandbox.create` ignores — it now maps to `diskMb`, so the requested disk size is honored. `SandboxResourceOptions` gains a typed `diskMb` field (Tensorlake), and the adapter accepts `diskMb` directly with `ephemeralDiskMb` kept as an alias.

  - computesdk@4.1.5
  - @computesdk/provider@2.1.6

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- 6ec91ff: Stream a command's output while it runs, over a provider's own process API. Providers can now implement `streamCommand` to serve `onStdout`/`onStderr` themselves instead of using the daemond SSE bridge, which needs a routable port inside the sandbox, and `streamCommandViaProcess` from `@computesdk/provider` does the whole lifecycle for them — deadline, best-effort kill, exit polling and recovering the tail when a follow connection drops — so a provider supplies only its start/follow/status/kill calls. Tensorlake is the first to use it, so a long-running command there reports line by line rather than only at exit.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7c6b99b: Remove hardcoded default image name and resource values when creating Tensorlake sandboxes; let the server choose defaults when options are omitted.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e07d46f: Fix `timeout` unit mismatch in the Tensorlake provider. `config.timeout` (passed to `tensorlake({ timeout: ... })`) was being forwarded to the underlying SDK as seconds while `options.timeout` (passed to `compute.sandbox.create({ timeout: ... })`) was correctly treated as milliseconds, contradicting the `TensorlakeConfig` interface comment. Both inputs are now consistently milliseconds and converted to seconds at the SDK boundary, matching the convention used by every other ComputeSDK provider.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b4ad62c: Add `@computesdk/tensorlake` provider for stateful MicroVM sandboxes powered by Tensorlake (https://tensorlake.ai), aimed at agentic applications and LLM-generated code execution. Wraps the `tensorlake` SDK and is auto-detected by the `computesdk` gateway via the `TENSORLAKE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial release of the Tensorlake provider for ComputeSDK
